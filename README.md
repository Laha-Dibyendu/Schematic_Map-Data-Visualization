# Assignment :
Pick your hometown or a city you are familiar with, and create a schematic map. You can find the slides from the refrence here.

The audience can be tourists (general, or specific types of attractions like pilgrimage, lakes, etc.), or a specific use case (such as cycling, educational institutes, etc.).

You can follow the following steps for your schematic map:

* Scale, Audience & Purpose
* Mental model sketch
* Tracing relevant aspects from OSM
* Abstraction: Grids & geometric shapes
* Simplification Vs Minimal
* Elements of the city
* Visual hierarchy
* Details: Icons, Typography, Legend, Context
You can see some of the previous schematic map exercises for reference.
