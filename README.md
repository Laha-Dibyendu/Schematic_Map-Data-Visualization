# Assignment :
Pick your hometown or a city you are familiar with, and create a schematic map. You can find the slides from [the refrence here](https://speakerdeck.com/rasagy/designing-schematic-maps).

The audience can be tourists (general, or specific types of attractions like pilgrimage, lakes, etc.), or a specific use case (such as cycling, educational institutes, etc.).

You can follow the following steps for your schematic map:

* Scale, Audience & Purpose
* Mental model sketch
* Tracing relevant aspects from OSM
* Abstraction: Grids & geometric shapes
* Simplification Vs Minimal
* Elements of the city
* Visual hierarchy
* Details: Icons, Typography, Legend, Context
You can see some of the previous [schematic map exercises](https://github.com/mapschool/course/issues?q=label%3A%22Schematic+Map%22+is%3Aclosed) for reference.

# Solution :
# Schematic_Map-Data-Visualization
 An assignment from the course Data Visualization. The assignment is made using Figma.

## Location : 
#### [Katwa, West Bengal](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Katwa,+West+Bengal/@23.6424019,88.1241386,15.93z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x39f9a7245d2881c7:0x39ea528616364624!8m2!3d23.6403783!4d88.1299373!16zL20vMDhzZmhf?entry=ttu)

## Audience : 
#### Any people coming to Katwa from nearby villages or other towns.

## Purpose
The purpose of the schematic map is to guide the general people coming to my town. Using this map, anyone visiting the town will easily know about the important places. The icons and landmarks will also help them to have a clear visual representation of the whole area.
